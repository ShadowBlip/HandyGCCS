# HandyGCCS
Handheld Game Console Controller Support (Handy Geeks) for Linux

Designed to bring the full controller functionality to handheld game consoles including:
- Programmable extra buttons
- Rumble effects

## Background
Many of the handheld game consoles designed for windows have buttons on then in addition to the normal "X-Box" style controls. These controls are typically keyboard macros for built in windows functions (such as CTRL+ALT+DEL). This software captures all input from these devices, as well as the built in controller, hides them from the system, and creates a new virtual controller that acts as a single input device. This ensures that input isn't duplicated, and all buttons appear to come from the same controller.
